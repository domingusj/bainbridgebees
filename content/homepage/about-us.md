##### Experience

My wife and I currently manage a few beehives on Bainbridge Island and want to help people learn more about bees. I volunteered as a Beekeeping Extension agent in the Peace Corps in Paraguay helping families build their own hives, capture wild swarms, and harvest their own honey to eat and sell. I also worked with the Ohio county extension office inspecting hives and helping with a small commercial operation.
