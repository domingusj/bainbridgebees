## Consulting

Do you want to have your own bees but don't know where to get started? We can help! We'll let you know what equipment you need, how to get bees, and teach you how to manage your own beehives.

## Managed Hives

Do you want to support bees on your property but not necessarily be involved in managing the hives? We can setup a beehive to pollinate your garden and fruit trees and stop by regularly to make sure the bees are happy and healthy.
